I stumbled upon a MYRIAD of tips, recommendations, doctrines, superstitions and bro-sciences… all of them promising to be the best when it comes to eating healthy… After more than two month absorbing pages and pages of information, two things came out as trustworthy and evidence-based enough for me to trust:  a healthy diet provides the minimum of macro- and micro-nutrients through whole foods as much as it is feasible, and a healthy diet contains (near-)zero of scientificaly studied unhealthy foods/nutrients. There are a ton of research online, good and not-so-good ones. I will focus on presenting below the ones I found to be evidence-based and from trust-worthy sources. This list is not exhaustive, but I did my best to list good sources you can get more information from if you wish. I hope it gives you a good head start!  If you got any questions, ask me on youtube or insta 😉 I will be happy to help!  Omegas 3 and 6 Fiber Cholesterol Saturated Fat Minerals     Calcium   Iron   Iodine   Sodium    Vitamins     Vitamin D   Vitamin B12   Vitamin A   Vitamin C   Vitamin E   Choline    Build a diet — practical advice TL;DR More sourcesOmegas 3 and 6You probably already heard about the importance of Omega 3’s, and maybe understand it is important to keep a balance intake of Omegas 3 and 6. The rule is pretty simple: for every milligram of Omega 3, you can eat between 1 and 5 milligrams of Omega 6. So any ratio between 1:1 and 1:5 should be good (source???), with the general recommendation being 1:2 or 1:3 — I personally strive for the 1:1, which showed sometimes to be the the ideal (source???). But maybe what you didn’t know about is that we have 3 types of Omega 3’s: ALA, EDH???, and DHA. I will not go too much in detail, what is important to remember is that even consuming only ALA our bodies can use it and create EDH??? and DHA. In summary, the minimum Omega 3 intake should be around:  X mg/day for ALA X mg/day for EDL??? X mg/day for DHAOne fact to keep in mind is that the efficiency of ALA-EDH-DHA conversion varies among humans. So a safer approach is to eat a small Omega 3 supplement with EDH and DHA. I personally take (this one every day - Amazonlink???), with X EDH??? and X DHA, and without any smell! (some Omega 3 supplements smell like fish 🥴 this one comes ???hidden span for future post???direct from the source: algaes(s???)??/hidden??) FiberMany people lack river on their diet! And fiber is super important for correct food digestion and nutrient absorption. If you eat mostly whole and plant-based foods, you already probably eat more than enough fiber! In summary, eat at the very least X g of fiber per day. I personally strive for at least X g of fiber (and usually eat much more) 😋 If you’re updating your diet now, increase your river intake slowly, otherwise your guts may not have time to adapt and you could feel constipated in the beginning. The good news is your body adapts in just a few weeks! CholesterolThis one is to be avoided. High cholesterol intake has shown to be detrimental for health (source???), and linked to diseases such as (list???). Humans do not need to consume any cholesterol, because our bodies can produce all that it needs, therefore my recommended intake is zero grams. Medical advice says to limit the daily intake to a maximum of X g per day or less. As a quick reminder, the only cholesterol sources in any diet are animal products we eat, such as meats, dairy and eggs. Plant-based foods have always zero cholesterol. Limiting or replacing animal products in your diet is a good idea. Saturated FatThis one is to be avoided, too. High saturated fat intake has shown to be detrimental for health, and be connected to many diseases, specially those related to your heart and blood flow. The recommended (source???) daily intake should be lower than X mg. I personally strive for X mg per day 🙂 As a quick reminder, most saturated fat sources are animal products we eat, such as meats, dairy and eggs. Most plant-based foods have low or zero saturated fats, with some exceptions like coconut oil. As I said previously, limiting or replacing animal products in your diet is a good idea.

    "body": "2023/01/22 -   Reasons why people go veganI can even give you myself as an example: I always call myself “vegan”, that’s what I identify with. Unfortunately, sometimes – for either lack of time, or mental strenght, or even knowledge – I did bought or used non-vegan things: vegetarian nuggets with eggs because did not read the package, small chocolates with milk because “needed chocolate”, winter clothers with wool because lacked time to research alternatives… guilty-trip do not help anyone, so let’s simply keep doing our human imperfect best! Title number two haha: I can even give you myself as an example: I always call myself “vegan”, that’s what I identify with. Unfortunately, sometimes – for either lack of time, or mental strenght, or even knowledge – I did bought or used non-vegan things: vegetarian nuggets with eggs because did not read the package, small chocolates with milk because “needed chocolate”, winter clothers with wool because lacked time to research alternatives… guilty-trip do not help anyone, so let’s simply keep doing our human imperfect best! Title number three haha: There are of course an infinitude of reasons why people choose to adopt veganism, and usually they involve:  Physical health: a diet whoch is rich in vegetables and other plants, and that seeks to avoid animal products, have been shown to be benefitial. [ref:] Environment: veganism helps the environment in many ways, such as reducing CO2 and other greenhouse gases emissions to help fight climate change, lessening pollution of waters and lands, dicreasing deforestation and therefore opening up space for wild life and biodiversity, and probably many more.  Animal welfare: in our modern society, where we have an increased access to knowledge, products and services, it is impossible to justify the assassination, exploitation and ultimately oppression of billion+ innocent animals weekly!What is it?It is simple: it is about the animals. Of course veganism has multiple benefits, such as personal health, environmental, societal… but ultimately, it is about the animals. The Vegan Society, who coined the term in 1944, define it as:  Veganism is a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude – as far as is possible and practicable – all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of animals, humans and the environment. In dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from animals. Can I call myself vegan?Remember one very important thing: veganism is not about perfection! You love cheese and “cannot live without”… well, adopt the other vegan habits, and try to reduce cheese consumption as you go forward – maybe make it a “guilty pleasure” to eat once in a while (?) Title for test     Title for test 2But… then you may ask “Can I call myself vegan and still eat cheese?!” – perhaps for clarity, say “vegan in progress” or “vegan in transitiom”, or even “mostly vegan”. Honesly, for me, if you are genuinely trying to reduce animal exploitation and oppression, I do not care that much about the words you use :) Actions are moreimportant. I can even give you myself as an example: I always call myself “vegan”, that’s what I identify with. Unfortunately, sometimes – for either lack of time, or mental strenght, or even knowledge – I did bought or used non-vegan things: vegetarian nuggets with eggs because did not read the package, small chocolates with milk because “needed chocolate”, winter clothers with wool because lacked time to research alternatives… guilty-trip do not help anyone, so let’s simply keep doing our human imperfect best! Easy steps to adopt vegan habits I would say the easiest number one is: start to, whenever you see a vegan or vegetarian option rightly available (restaurant, fast food, delivery, supermarket) go for that option! At a supermarket, if you see the plant-milk there, buy it… At a fast food, if you see the vegetarian pizza or plant-burger, go for that one! Perhaps next easist one would be: stop drinking cows’ milk – just change for a plant-milk, there are tons of options (soy, almond, coconut, oat, hazelnut). Choose yours (tip: taste varies from brand to brand).  Another kinda easy one: stop eating meat – you can go gradually, first stop red meat, then chicken, then fish… or cut it all at once. If done gradually, write in your calendar every X months an event “Stop X meat” ;) The good news are: almost all places nowadays have great vegetarian options! Be curious: try the vegan alternatives, and keep trying (even the same ones, on different recipes)! You may be surprised, and find your newesr favorite patty or tofu recipe… Experiment with new recipes: are you going to cook something woth friends or family? Search for a vegan recipe online, it is always nice to try new things together! Remember veganism is not a diet: clothes, cosmetics, watches, wallets, backpacks… many items around us may contain animal parts or involve animal exploitation. Grow your awareness little by little, remember to look for alternatives when you go shopping, ask the salesperson if they have alternatives, look up online too!"

But soon, reading trustworthy sources (attention to fake news) I saw veganism has far more benefits than simply health:  it’s also about #tgc and respecting animals (not just pets, everyone), and also about #tgc and preserving our planet (the only one we got 😉)All people I met after I started this adventure are good, some even curious:  where do you get your proteins? why such an “extreme” choice? but and milk/eggs/honey? 🐮🐔🐝Some are already vegan (they inspire me, and often share “vegan secrets” about conquering the world 🤫 cooking). And some even said I inspired them to make conscious choices (I love to hear I inspired someone to #tgc of their self)!  « Run to the rescue with love and peace will follow »  — Joaquin Phoenix (Oscars 2020) And now… The famous recipes! 😋 CHOCOLATE CAKE:  325g flour 100g cocoa 20g baking powder 200g sugar ½ tsp. of salt 500ml vegetable milk 1 tsp. of vanilla extract 60ml vegetable oil of neutral tasteMix all dry ingredients; Mix the dry and wet ingredients in an electric mixer; Cook for 45min in a 175°C temperature.
