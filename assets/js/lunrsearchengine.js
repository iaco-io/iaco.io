Back then I was looking for PhD’s, because to be 100% honest with you… I had no idea of what I wanted to do with my life, and PhD seemed a good and productive way to postpone such a decision for a few more years :) I remember until this day: me, at my mom’s basement (she is the sweetest, she had prepared a full room just for me to come and live with her for a few months), 2 a. m. in the night, reseraching on my computer how to eat healthy? I stumbled upon MANY different tips, recommendations, doctrines, superstitions and bro-sciences… all of them swearing to be the best when it comes to eating healthy… After more than a month compiling pages and pages of information, two things came out as trustworthy and evidence-based enough for me to trust:  a healthy diet provides the minimum of macro- and micro-nutrients through whole foods as much as it is feasible, and a healthy diet contains (near-)zero of scientificaly studied unhealthy foods/nutrients. There are a ton of research online "

Unfortunately, sometimes – for either lack of time, or mental strenght, or even knowledge – I did bought or used non-vegan things: vegetarian nuggets with eggs because did not read the package, small chocolates with milk because “needed chocolate”, winter clothers with wool because lacked time to research alternatives… guilty-trip do not help anyone, so let’s simply keep doing our human imperfect best!

Title number three haha: There are of course an infinitude of reasons why people choose to adopt veganism, and usually they involve:  Physical health: a diet whoch is rich in vegetables and other plants, and that seeks to avoid animal products, have been shown to be benefitial. [ref:] Environment: veganism helps the environment in many ways, such as reducing CO2 and other greenhouse gases emissions to help fight climate change, lessening pollution of waters and lands, dicreasing deforestation and therefore opening up space for wild life and biodiversity, and probably many more.  Animal welfare: in our modern society, where we have an increased access to knowledge, products and services, it is impossible to justify the assassination, exploitation and ultimately oppression of billion+ innocent animals weekly!What is it?It is simple: it is about the animals. Of course veganism has multiple benefits, such as personal health, environmental, societal… but ultimately, it is about the animals. The Vegan Society, who coined the term in 1944, define it as:  Veganism is a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude – as far as is possible and practicable – all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of animals, humans and the environment. In dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from animals. Can I call myself vegan?Remember one very important thing: veganism is not about perfection! You love cheese and “cannot live without”… well, adopt the other vegan habits, and try to reduce cheese consumption as you go forward – maybe make it a “guilty pleasure” to eat once in a while (?) Title for test     Title for test 2But… then you may ask “Can I call myself vegan and still eat cheese?!” – perhaps for clarity, say “vegan in progress” or “vegan in transitiom”, or even “mostly vegan”. Honesly, for me, if you are genuinely trying to reduce animal exploitation and oppression, I do not care that much about the words you use :) Actions are moreimportant. I can even give you myself as an example: I always call myself “vegan”, that’s what I identify with. Unfortunately, sometimes – for either lack of time, or mental strenght, or even knowledge – I did bought or used non-vegan things: vegetarian nuggets with eggs because did not read the package, small chocolates with milk because “needed chocolate”, winter clothers with wool because lacked time to research alternatives… guilty-trip do not help anyone, so let’s simply keep doing our human imperfect best! Easy steps to adopt vegan habits I would say the easiest number one is: start to, whenever you see a vegan or vegetarian option rightly available (restaurant, fast food, delivery, supermarket) go for that option! At a supermarket, if you see the plant-milk there, buy it… At a fast food, if you see the vegetarian pizza or plant-burger, go for that one! Perhaps next easist one would be: stop drinking cows’ milk – just change for a plant-milk, there are tons of options (soy, almond, coconut, oat, hazelnut). Choose yours (tip: taste varies from brand to brand).  Another kinda easy one: stop eating meat – you can go gradually, first stop red meat, then chicken, then fish… or cut it all at once. If done gradually, write in your calendar every X months an event “Stop X meat” ;) The good news are: almost all places nowadays have great vegetarian options! Be curious: try the vegan alternatives, and keep trying (even the same ones, on different recipes)! You may be surprised, and find your newesr favorite patty or tofu recipe… Experiment with new recipes: are you going to cook something woth friends or family? Search for a vegan recipe online, it is always nice to try new things together! Remember veganism is not a diet: clothes, cosmetics, watches, wallets, backpacks… many items around us may contain animal parts or involve animal exploitation. Grow your awareness little by little, remember to look for alternatives when you go shopping, ask the salesperson if they have alternatives, look up online too!"

It all started with my quest to improve my nutrition, because I love to take good care #tgc of my body and health 🧖‍♂️. Most people don’t realize, but our food is fundamental for an optimum health (together with rest 🧘‍♂️ and exercise 💪). But soon, reading trustworthy sources (attention to fake news) I saw veganism has far more benefits than simply health:  it’s also about #tgc and respecting animals (not just pets, everyone), and also about #tgc and preserving our planet (the only one we got 😉)All people I met after I started this adventure are good, some even curious:  where do you get your proteins? why such an “extreme” choice? but and milk/eggs/honey? 🐮🐔🐝Some are already vegan (they inspire me, and often share “vegan secrets” about conquering the world 🤫 cooking). And some even said I inspired them to make conscious choices (I love to hear I inspired someone to #tgc of their self)!  « Run to the rescue with love and peace will follow »  — Joaquin Phoenix (Oscars 2020) And now… The famous recipes! 😋 CHOCOLATE CAKE:  325g flour 100g cocoa 20g baking powder 200g sugar ½ tsp. of salt 500ml vegetable milk 1 tsp. of vanilla extract 60ml vegetable oil of neutral tasteMix all dry ingredients; Mix the dry and wet ingredients in an electric mixer; Cook for 45min in a 175°C temperature.
