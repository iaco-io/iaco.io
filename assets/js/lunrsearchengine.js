    "body": "2023/09/28 - In order to enjoy life, I think it is important to first take care of our body, after all it will support us on every activity we do, physical or mental… so let’s treat it with some love ;) I like to organise our physical health in 3 dimensions:   Nutrition 🍉  A nutritiously balanced diet means we consciously choose what we eat. And of course, making it enjoyable is part of the adventure!    Exercise 💪  Our bodies evolved for movement, so the secret here is find out which activity makes us the happiest, and stick to it on the long term!    Sleep 😴  When we sleep, our brain and body are not just resting, they are working hard: cleaning up and fixing memories, repairing and healing muscles…  All of us probably know about these 3 dimensions, it is kinda “common sense”, but why is it so hard for us to create healthier habits around them? For me, I l we try to answer these questions:  what defines a nutritious diet? 🍉 what regular and proper exercise is? 💪 what does it mean to sleep well? 😴I will list below what is my current strategy to tackle such questions, and how I’m working to develop 3 healthier habits to increase my physical health: Eat a Nutritious Diet 🍉I am following a weekly 6-days meal plan 🍉 The basics I am following are simple:  Be sure to meet the weekly nutritional needs: minimum of 6 x RDA (Reference Daily Intake). In practice, it means some days may be slightly lower in some nutrients, but the other days will then compensate.  Eat as low as possible of unecessary or detrimental elements (such as refined sugar/oil, saturated fat, cholesterol, etc).  Try to make it simple and delicious: incorporate meal prep in my routine, incorporate foods I love in the plan (cake ;)In summary: It may take some time for you to find a good diet plan, but in any case it is important to keep in mind: t does not mean eating boring food. It does not mean paying extreme attention to calories. It does not mean Exercise Regularly 💪A Sleep Well 😴This one may seem the easiest, but as I am writing this very text I am actually harming my health a bit. It is exactly 00:01 and I should be sleeping… A To know more about the evidence-based and practical solutions I am using, follow me on my Instagram and my YouTube:                                                   YouTube        :                                                                       Instagram        :                                     I just started this online adventure!            Soon I wish to send my first newsletter, and you can join me by subscribing here ;)                                                        "

    "body": "2023/09/27 - Hello, I’m IACO! A curious fact about me: I often write my name as “IACO” or “iaco” because – more times than I can count – people mix my “i” for an “L”… 😂 I am a PhD engineer, and I can remember my younger self spending hours and hours navigating through the internet: reading articles, watching videos, trying tools… going into flow state researching about ways to improve the quality-of-life (not only the quality of my life, but of the world too – it is fascinating to learn what we can do with the knowledge and tools we have today).  My Mom used to describe my flow state as “going inside the computer” 🤭   I care about life in general, and when I say quality-of-life I refer to things that empower ourselves individually, like:      healthy constructive habits   lifestyle choices   nutrition, sleep, exercise   productivity &amp; time management     As well as things that empower ourselves collectively, like:      relationships to friends &amp; family   our impact on the lives of those we love (and on those we do not even know)   our responsibilities as humans in a globalised world   On one hand🫲 I feel that, over the years, I learned a bunch of valuable information online, most of them supported by good evidence-based research or with practical real-life application. On the other hand🫱, I feel I struggled to apply them on my life, either for lack of time, motivation, or even a lack of answer to where the heck do I make my first step?  So here is my first step today 👣 I will share with the world all evidence-based and practical solutions I am applying myself, and with no filters: I will tell you about the good and the not-so-good My ambition is that, by consciously building healthier habits and constructive lifestyle choices, I can accomplish 3 goals:  Apply evidence-based and practical solutions I learned 💪 so my quality-of-life goes up Share them with you, so you apply them yourself 🫵 and your quality-of-life goes up Receive direct feedback from you 🤝 so I learn if I missed something – tell me ;)To know more about the evidence-based and practical solutions I am using for building healthier habits and more, follow me on my Instagram and my YouTube:                                                   YouTube        :                                                                       Instagram        :                                     I just started this online adventure!
